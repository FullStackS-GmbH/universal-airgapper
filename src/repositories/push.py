    """Handles pushing a specific Git reference from a local repository to a remote
    repository using different modes and optional authentication methods.

    Args:
        local_repo_path (str | Path): The local repository path from which the reference
            should be pushed. This can be a string path or a Path object.
        remote_url (str): URL of the remote repository to which the reference will be
            pushed.
        ref (str): The name of the reference (branch or tag) to be pushed.
        push_mode (PushMode, optional): Determines how the reference is pushed.
            defaults to "push".
            If set to "push", the reference is pushed normally.
            If "force", it overrides any existing remote reference.
            If "skip", the push will be skipped if the reference already exists.
        username (Optional[str], optional): Username for HTTPS-based authentication.
            Required only if the `remote_url` uses HTTPS without a pre-configured
            authentication method.
        password (Optional[str], optional): Password for HTTPS-based authentication,
            required along with `username`. An optional environment variable name can
            also be provided for advanced authentication configurations.
        ssh_key_path (Optional[str], optional):
            Path to the SSH private key used for SSH-based authentication.
            Required only if the `remote_url` uses SSH and an explicit key is needed.

    Returns:
        RC: A result object summarizing the outcome of the push. Contains `ok` (bool)
            indicating success or failure, a `message` (str) detailing the result,
            and `ref` (str) specifying the pushed reference.

    Raises:
        Exception: If an error occurs during the push process, it is caught and logged,
        and the function returns a failure `RC` instance instead of propagating the
        error.
